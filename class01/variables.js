//  Here we'll be learning the concept of variables in TypeScript.
//  A variable is a container for storing data values.
//  A variable is created the moment you first
//  assign a value to it.
//  A variable must be declared before it is used.
var x = 10; // here it's a variable x whose type is number.
var y = "Hello World"; // here it's a variable y whose type is string.
var userName = "Abdul Wahab";
console.log(userName);
console.log(x);
console.log(y);
